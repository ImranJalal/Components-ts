# Project Overview

Hi,

This is my first time publishing a project, so I’m unsure of how useful it will be. This is a work-in-progress React project focused on setting up components, with detailed explanations and breakdowns of the code from both a developer and software engineering perspective.

## Timeline and Scope

I have included estimated completion and publication dates for each of the components outlined below and will make every effort to adhere to the timeline I’ve set. If anyone would like to propose additional activities outside of the listed scope that would be beneficial for both our learning experiences, feel free to add them at the bottom.

### Things to Come:
- **Docker Setup**: Comprehensive instructions and explanatory notes for effectively setting up and utilizing Docker.  
  _Expected Completion: 1/15/2025_

- **Nginx Deployment**: A guide on configuring Nginx for publishing and hosting on a local server.

- **Environment Variable Management**: Secure setup and management of environment variables for development, QA, and production environments.  
  _Expected Completion: 1/15/2025_

### Components to Come:

#### Form Components:
- **Login Form**: For user authentication.
- **Registration Form**: For user sign-up.
- **Feedback Form**: To gather user feedback.

#### Card/Cart Components:
- **Product Card**: Displays product image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- **User Card**: Displays user profile picture, name, and contact information.
- **Dashboard Card**: Highlights KPIs like "Total Sales" or "Active Users."

#### Search and Filter Components:
- **Search Bar**: For searching products, users, or content.
- **Filter Panel**: For narrowing down results by category, price, etc.

## Outside Scope Activities:
If you have any additional suggestions or activities that fall outside of the current scope but would be beneficial to our learning, feel free to add them here.
